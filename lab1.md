* Remotely Connecting
  * Tried to reset password of course-specific ieng6 account during lab session, but the password was not updated until the day after Lab session. 
 Therefore, moved on to the next step (Part 6) to create personal Github page instead of working Part 4 and 5.
  * Finally logged into ieng6 course account using ssh command in terminal on the next day.
  * Cluster Status was shown on the screen at first and then the system allow user to type some codes.
